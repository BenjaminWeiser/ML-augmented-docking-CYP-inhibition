# Code Workflow Procedure
1. Cleaned and combined test and train Pei sets with CYP\_clean\_files.ipnyb. Sets combined and then clustered to create new train and test sets
2. Dock each ligand 5 times to its respective isoform using FITTED. Docked data can be found here: (to be inserted)
3. Create analogue sets using FITTED. Create max train-test similarity using CYP\_TC\_DataSets.py
4. Run RF with Feature Importances using max train-test similarity of 0.8 using ML\_over\_Tanimoto.py which calls CYP\_inhibition\_functions.py and Do\_ML2.py 
5. Using these selected features run all ML models on all datasets using ML\_over\_Tanimoto.py which calls CYP\_inhibition\_functions.py and Do\_ML2.py 
6. Use CYP_evaluate_and_ensemble.py which calls CYP_evaluate_and_ensemble_functions.py to make ensembles and evaluate and graph model performance

All code and folders focused in this project were in a folder called EnsembleLearning which you will have to change to your directory
Can run code, CYP_evaluate_and_ensemble, to load and evaluate models from ../CSVFiles/TanimotoCSV_Final

# Train Models
Trained model can be found in CSVFiles/TanimotoCSV_Final/Models
MaxTC is model made using different max train-test Tanimoto shown in figure 5, 7, 8
MaxTCsamed is model made using different max train-test Tanimoto with same data size shown in figure 6
Analog is model trained using the anolog datasets shown in figure 9

# Docking Data
Results_CSV_ZIPPED contains all docked data used To implement into the workflow for replication unzip into /EnsembleLearning/CSVFiles/TanimotoCSV_Final/Results_CSV

# Datasets
In CSVFiles/TanimotoCSV_Final: 
80TC_TESTSETS contains the test sets for MaxTC
Analog_Clusters contains all the data for the analog sets
Clusters_Max_TC contains all the MaxTC clusters
Smiles contains all the original smiles of the Pei sets
